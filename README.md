A Frontend Developer. I started my journey as a web developer in 2020. As well as work I also continued to keep learning and exploring new technologies for updating myself. I've made myself more efficient and productive. I love to learn new technologies and work on them. I strongly believe there is always "One More Thing" to learn.

Skills:  HTML / CSS / BOOTSTRAP / TAILWINDCSS / JAVASCRIPT

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react
